/**
 * Validate a pipeline graph against the port-graph contract above.
 *
 * @param graph - a value from ``{ agents, connections }``, or null/undefined
 *   (an absent pipeline is valid: there is simply nothing to run).
 * @returns `{ ok, errors, warnings? }` where `ok` is true only when `errors`
 *   is empty. Each error/warning is `{ code, message }`; `code` is a stable
 *   discriminator (link of the class of problem) and `message` is a
 *   human-readable, targeted string (e.g. which agent / connection / port is
 *   at fault). `warnings` carries non-fatal findings (`cycle-present`) and is
 *   present only when non-empty.
